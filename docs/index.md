# Gofannon Documentation
Welcome to the Gofannon documentation! This project provides a collection of tools and APIs for working with large language models.

## Overview
Gofannon is designed to provide a flexible and extensible framework for building applications on top of large language models. The toolbox includes a range of tools and APIs for tasks such as text generation, question answering, and conversational dialogue.

## Getting Started
To get started with Gofannon, please see the [CONTRIBUTING](../CONTRIBUTING.md) guide for information on how to contribute to the project.

## Logging

See [LOGGING.md](LOGGING.md)

## APIs
Gofannon provides a range of APIs for working with large language models. These APIs are organized into several categories, including:

* [ArXiv API](arxiv/): provides access to arXiv papers and metadata
* [Basic Math API](basic_math/): provides basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
* [File Operations](file/): Tools for interacting with the local filesystem.
* [GitHub API](github/): provides access to GitHub repositories and issues
* [Google Search API](google_search/): provides access to Google search results.
* [Headless Browser](headless_browser/): Tools for fetching web content rendered with JavaScript.
* [NASA APIs](nasa/): Tools for accessing NASA data (e.g., APOD).
* [NHTSA API](nhsta/): provides access to NHTSA vehicle safety data
* [Open Notify Space API](open_notify_space/): Tools for space-related data (e.g., ISS location).
* [Reasoning API (deprecated)](reasoning/): provides tools for reasoning and problem-solving with large language models
* [Simpler.Grants.Gov API](simpler_grants_gov/): provides access to grant opportunity data from Grants.gov.
* [Wikipedia API](wikipedia/): provides access to Wikipedia article summaries.
